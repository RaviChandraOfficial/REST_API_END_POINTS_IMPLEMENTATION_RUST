# SensorSync
"SensorSync" is an advanced data management platform designed to seamlessly handle sensor data through robust API endpoints.

This project comprises three key tasks:

Implement API Endpoints
Efficiently manage sensor data with a set of well-defined API endpoints. Retrieve data with flexible filtering, sorting, and pagination options using the GET method, submit new sensor data securely through the POST method, update specific readings through the PUT method, and ensure secure deletions with the DELETE method. The project utilizes SQLX and a PostgreSQL database for efficient storage and retrieval of sensor data.

Add Authentication and Authorization
Leveraging the power of AWS Cognito, this task involves implementing a secure user authentication system. Users can seamlessly log in, sign up, and log out, ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive sensor data.

Build REST API and Web Frontend with YEW.rs
Create a comprehensive solution by developing a REST API to post and manage sensor data. Simultaneously, build a dynamic web interface using YEW.rs, providing users with an intuitive and responsive platform to interact with the sensor data. The native GUI for the application ensures a seamless experience, allowing users to fetch, save, update, and delete data through the backend REST API.

In summary, "SensorSync " not only streamlines the management of sensor data through powerful API functionalities but also ensures the security of the system through robust authentication and authorization mechanisms. The inclusion of a user-friendly web interface enhances the overall user experience, making it a versatile and comprehensive solution for sensor data management.
